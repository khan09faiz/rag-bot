# Evaluation Report

Run evaluation with `npm run evaluate` after starting the dev server and ingesting documents.

Report will include:
- Precision@k and Recall@k (approximated by evaluator)
- Reranker improvement (comparison before/after rerank)
- Success rate of grounded answers

(Use `evaluation/` scripts and test data to generate reports.)
